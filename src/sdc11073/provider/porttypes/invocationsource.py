"""Determination of ``msg:InvocationSource`` for operation invoked reports.

IEEE Std 11073-20701-2018, 7.2.2 (SDC glue) defines how an SDC SERVICE PROVIDER identifies the SDC
PARTICIPANT that invoked a SERVICE OPERATION when it fills
``msg:OperationInvokedReportPart/msg:InvocationSource``:

- **R0077**: an unknown (not authenticated) participant is identified by a fixed anonymous instance
  identifier.
- **R0078**: a known participant is identified by the Common Name of the Distinguished Name of its
  x.509 certificate, using a dedicated ``@Root``.

Identifying a known participant by its Common Name is under discussion, so both identifications are offered as
``SdcProviderComponents.invocation_source_factory``:

- :func:`mk_pem_certificate_invocation_source` (default) identifies it by its entire PEM encoded certificate, as
  proposed by the discussed corrigendum of R0078.
- :func:`mk_common_name_invocation_source` identifies it by the Common Name of its certificate, as the released R0078
  requires. It needs the optional dependency ``cryptography`` (``pip install sdc11073[cryptography]``).
